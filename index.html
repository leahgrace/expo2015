								<h2>Joe Courtney</h2>
								<h4>Team Leader</h4>
							<p>Joe is a Computer Information Systems major from Glenwood, Illinois (Which is just south of Chicago since no one knows where Glenwood is). He has been programming since the age of thirteen when his dad got him a programming book. He has worked for almost five years as a Web Developer, doing work in-house for Edsal Manufacturing Company in Chicago, IL; this has given him the experience to work on development projects for and with big companies like Home Depot, Lowe's, and Sam's Club. His hobbies include Web development, artificial intelligence, home automation, and game development. After graduation he hopes to work as a Web developer while getting his Master's degree in Web Development, and start his own company.</p>

								<h4>Assistant Team Leader</h4>
							<p>Born in Rockford, Illinois Larry Bahr has been interested in electronics from a young age. As a child it was not uncommon for his parents to come home and have some device in pieces being "upgraded." This frustrating childhood habit quickly evolved into a useful skill that he has used to develop printer monitoring software, home automation, websites, and a wide array of other projects. After college Larry plans to get married, start his career in software engineering, and get involved in his local church.</p>

							<p>Dory is an avid bookworm from Greenville, Texas who loves cats and the color green. Growing up she spent much of her free time playing computer games with her siblings, and helping her dad fix computers. Working with her dad on computers throughout her childhood instilled a love of the computer hardware aspect of computer science. Despite not learning any programming before coming to college, Dory has learned to love programming and the challenge of solving problems during her four years here at PCC. Her current plan is to go back home and get a job with L-3 Communications Center and gain experience to do whatever the Lord would have her do.</p>

							<p>Josiah grew up in the city of Portage which is close to Gary, Indiana where he spent most of his childhood outdoors and riding around town on his bike. He became interested in computers when his family got their first desktop computer at the turn of the century. His parents could not understand the machine but he quickly picked up on how it worked and was able to fix some bugs and enjoyed playing computer games. When it was time to choose a major at PCC he chose to further his education in the computer field. He started programming when he came to PCC and enjoys dealing with collecting information and finding bugs. He plans to move to Chicago and become a software developer.</p>

								<h2>Brandon Carroll</h2>
								<img class="bio" src="img/Team Members/Brandon.jpg" alt="Brandon">
								<h4>Team Leader</h4>
							<p>Born in Mansfield, Ohio, Brandon’s family relocated to a suburb of Columbus, Ohio when he was six, and has lived there ever since. He first began experimenting with computers and programming in the sixth grade when his parents bought him a computer as a Christmas gift. As a 13 year old he built his first website so he could share with others things that he had created in his favorite game. Since building that first website, Brandon has had years of experience as a freelance web designer and developer, and has worked the past three years at an education technology company in Dayton, Ohio as a web development intern. Brandon is returning to the Columbus, Ohio area after graduating. He plans to start his own technology company in the next five years; ideally it will be cloud-based software that helps people make easy, relevant, skill-based connections. </p>

								<h2>Josh Bennett</h2>
								<h4>Assistant Team Leader</h4>
							<p>The ability to solve problems was what drew Josh, a resident of Charlotte, North Carolina to the Computer Science department here at PCC. While he had no previous computer programming experience, he liked computers, and wanted to be a part of developing technology. Josh is always trying new ways to solve a problem, and he is constantly looking to learn new concepts and innovations in the Computer Science field. He is hoping to pursue a career in Web Development.</p>

								<h2>Erin Hutcheson</h2>
								<img src="img/Team Members/Erin.jpg" alt="Erin">
								<h4>User Experience Specialist</h4>
								<h4>Expo Coordinator</h4>
							<p>Born and raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, Erin, a devoted chocoholic, developed a love of words from an early age. She began to learn to read at the age of 3, and discovered the library at the age of 7. No doubt spending so much time in books at such a young age sparked her creativity and imagination. When she got her first computer in 9th grade she naturally drifted towards design. Being an analytical person who loves pulling things apart to see how they work, she chose to major in Software Engineering. She has enjoyed learning about the overall Software Engineering process. Being able to collaborate with potential consumers, and working together with a team to create a well-designed application has been a great experience.</p>

								<h2>Glenn Hatt</h2>
								<h4>Database Administrator</h4>
							<p>Glenn, a 6’7” resident of Marco Island, Florida, came to PCC as a freshman Elementary Education Major. A few of his friends were computer nerds, and they tried to convince him that Computer Science was the way to go. His sophomore year he took a basic programming class and was sold. He loves the satisfaction of writing a complicated program from scratch and getting it to work well. Glenn has played a huge role in data storage and retrieval by working on the database side of programming for the project.</p>

								<h2>Rob McCarville</h2>

								<h4>Front-End Specialist</h4>
							<p>Rob, ninth out of 11 siblings, grew up in Michigan, where he spent most of his time outdoors, hiking, swimming, and generally causing trouble. His first experience with computers consisted of playing a simple math game on an 8-inch floppy disk. A couple of years before he came to college, Rob began fiddling with the home computer. He decided to major in Computer Science because he thought computers were fun. He has grown to appreciate both troubleshooting program bugs, and writing programs that help solve everyday problems. He has spent much of his time in this project working with testing the software for bugs.</p>
